# History
NAU is an institution of higher education founded as Texas Gulf Institute in April 2007. The institute offered certificate programs for the first two years of its inception. Upon approval by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board (THECB) to offer bachelor's degree programs in July 2010, the school applied to change its name to North American College (NAC).

During the 2010–11 academic year the college moved into its new administrative and educational building located at 3203 N. Sam Houston Pkwy West in Houston, Texas. In 2017, physician Serif Ali Tekalan was appointed the third president of the university, succeeding Recayi "Reg" Pecen, an engineer, who had been appointed in 2012.[3]

In May 2013, the college had its first commencement. The class of 2013 included twelve students; nine graduated with a bachelor's degree in business administration and three with a bachelor's degree in interdisciplinary studies in education.[4]

In the fall of 2013, NAC changed to its name to North American University (NAU). There are more than 800 students in its ESL, bachelor's degree and master's degree programs. Students come from over 33 U.S. states and over 54 countries.[5]

## Academics
NAU offers three bachelor's degree programs: Interdisciplinary Studies in Education, Computer Science, Criminal Justice and Business Administration. Bachelor's degree programs are organized under a different administrative department. NAU also offers five master's degree programs: M.Ed. in educational leadership, M.Ed. in Curriculum and Instruction, M.Ed. in School Counseling, MBA, and an M.S. in Computer Science.

The university is accredited by the Accrediting Commission of Career Schools and Colleges and approved by Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board to award bachelor's and master's degrees. The Gulf Language School is accredited by The Commission on English Language Program Accreditation.

In June 2023 the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools educational accreditor rejected the university's application for accreditation. The accreditor's board found NAU unable to comply with the board's standards for hiring full-time faculty, financial resources and financial documentation.[6]
